## What is PixelCanvas
PixelCanvas is a collaborative web-based game where users can draw and paint on a shared pixel canvas. Players can create shapes, patterns and designs that are visible to all other users. There are also limits on the number of pixels that can be painted per user.

## usage
1. __Ensure Git and Docker is installed on your system.__
2. __Clone the repository:__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PooyaRezaee/PixelCanvas
```
2. __Run the application using Docker Compose:__
```bash
docker-compose -d up
```
3. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost (the app runs on port 80 by default).


_The frontend of the game will be designed soon. Once completed, it will be available here._
